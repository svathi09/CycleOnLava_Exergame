CycleOnLava - VR Exergame

CycleOnLava is a VR exergame that uses Unity 2018.2.8f1 and an exercise bicycle to evaluate the effects of loss aversion versus reward penalty system on an exergame.
This is an endless runner style game, where the roads loop around the course. The game has obstacles such as pitfalls, spikes and rocks, which must be avoided or sped over to avoid increase in resistance.
The resistance increase and decrease is predefined as shown in class demo. Resistance increases (if applicable) when the user fails to pass the spikes with the predefined speed threshold, whereas the resistance decreases (if applicable) when the user successfully passes the spikes with the predefined speed threshold.

Getting Started

Make sure the exerbike and Oculus Rift is paired and working with the computer.

Changing Modes
To change the modes between loss aversion and reward and penalty system, use the "GlobalSettings" file within the plugins folder and change the variable "isLossAversion" to true for loss aversion mode and false for reward penalty mode.

Results 
More calories were burnt using the loss aversion mode. 
Statistically more participants enjoyed loss aversion mode than reward penalty mode.
